    <h2>What is the Universe?</h2>
    <p>The undead, mysterious <strong>universe</strong> of ours cannot be simply recreated. The universe is what is outside of earth, and there is too much of it
    to even comprehend. This recipe is specifically more on gamma ray bursts, which are a phenomena in a universe when a massive star collapses into a black hole.</p>
    <h2>Why make a Gamma-Ray Burst?</h2>
    <strong><em><p>Please don't, even if you are as strong as god please don't do this for life's sake</p></em></strong>
    <h3>What is needed to make a Gamma-Ray Burst?</h3>
    <p>The Ingredients (and instructions?):</p>
    <ul><li>A massive star about to run out of fuel which you'll never find unless you're god</li>
        <li>Let the star do its job and... <em>just float there and watch?</em></li>
        <li>Admire the new black hole that is created and energy released in beams in both directions.</li><ol><li>Be careful not to die</li></ol>
        <li>At this point, it's not even a war crime. It's a full on universe threat level crime.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions - How to make the Gamma-Ray Burst</h3>
    <ol><li>Who said I should tell you?</li>
        <li>You'll never be able to do it in your measly little lifetime anyway.</li>
        <li>You will only witness this, not recreate it. Just watch as the star does it's job and collapses itself.</li>
    </ol>
